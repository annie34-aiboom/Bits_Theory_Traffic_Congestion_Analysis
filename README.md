# Project Description
Traffic congestion is a prevalent issue in urban areas, leading to increased travel times, higher pollution levels, and significant economic costs. This project aims to analyze traffic congestion patterns, identify the primary factors contributing to congestion, and propose data-driven strategies to alleviate traffic jams and enhance overall traffic flow
# Objective
 This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of traffic congestion in urban areas. Using a combination of historical data, real-time traffic information, and predictive modeling, the project aims to identify congestion hotspots, understand underlying causes, and propose actionable solutions
Features
Data Collection: Scripts for gathering traffic data from multiple sources.

Data Cleaning: Methods for preprocessing and cleaning raw data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistics to reveal traffic patterns and trends.

Predictive Modeling: Machine learning models to predict future traffic congestion.

Visualization Tools: Interactive dashboards and maps for real-time traffic monitoring.

Reports and Insights: Comprehensive reports with findings and recommendations.

# Tools and Libraries Used
Programming Languages: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, Plotly, Dash

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook,spyer-py3
# Data Source(s)
Historical Traffic Data: Sourced from local traffic authorities and public datasets.
