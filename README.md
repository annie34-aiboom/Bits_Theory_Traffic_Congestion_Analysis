# Project Description
This project aims to analyze the traffic congestion in a city using bits theory. The project will involve collecting
# Objective
 This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of traffic congestion in urban areas. Using a combination of historical data, real-time traffic information, and predictive modeling, the project aims to identify congestion hotspots, understand underlying causes, and propose actionable solutions
Features
Data Collection: Scripts for gathering traffic data from multiple sources.

Data Cleaning: Methods for preprocessing and cleaning raw data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistics to reveal traffic patterns and trends.

Predictive Modeling: Machine learning models to predict future traffic congestion.

Visualization Tools: Interactive dashboards and maps for real-time traffic monitoring.

Reports and Insights: Comprehensive reports with findings and recommendations.

# Tools and Libraries Used
Programming Languages: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, Plotly, Dash

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook,spyer-py3
# Data Source(s)
